# Stay safe in snowy mountains — regardless of how you travel
*This guide is meant to equip the reader with a baseline knowledge for safe travel in mountainous winter terrain. It supplements — but does not replace the professional hands-on training offered by the [AIARE content and courses](https://avtraining.org/recprogram/), and practice with planning and Search and Rescue (SAR) tools. It is not affiliated with any formal educational provider. Your writer holds a [American Avalanche Institute AIARE Level II certification](https://www.americanavalancheinstitute.com/course/avalanche-level-2/). He has accumulated two decades of snow condition study by adventuring through the western mountains in nearly all known means and conditions.*

Hey — Caleb here (commonly pronounced Cawleeb 😏).
> This guide shoots to expand beyond the usual 2 line snow safety dialogue of: "Yes, bring a beacon, shovel, and probe. No, don't go on or under slopes ≥ 30°." <a href="#full-intro">Read more</a>

## Critical snow safety tools
- Beacon, shovel, and probe
- Smartphone or device with a [gradient color-shaded mapping app](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=40.56771,-111.64002&z=15&b=mbt&a=sg) and an inclinometer app

## Recommended extras
- First-aid kit
- Extra insulating layers and emergency shelter
- Navigation backup (paper map & compass, extra power)



## Tutorial: Using a slope-angle shader / inclinometer

1. Open your gradient-shaded map (CalTopo, Gaia, etc.) and enable slope shading. 
*Insert a how-to GIF here*
2. Use an inclinometer app or the map's tools to measure the slope angle on your planned route.
3. Treat slopes ≥ 30° as high-risk avalanche terrain and avoid travel there unless you have formal avalanche training and a conservative group decision process.



## Hazard type
In addition to the many potentially precarious ways that trees, roots and rocks can be rearranged, there are a couple of 
particularly dangerous terrain hazards that are not always obvious to the average user. Winter wilderness travelers should avoid going alone when at all possible due to potentially getting caught by one of these unexpected dangers without a counterpart to help you escape. 

  #### Terrain traps:
  Convex features like bowls or chutes that will tend to funnel mobile snow to a far deeper level than expected. 


  #### [Tree wells](https://deepsnowsafety.org/tree-wells/)
  While the skiable snow at a tree's base (especially dense trees like pines) may appear to be just as level and dense as everything around it, it is actually far less dense than the distanced snow from the base.

  #### Roof slides

What ought this piece to be once those notes are made?
Can detail how to use a transciever, shovel, and probe, 
Need some structure, maybe divide into 3 parts?
