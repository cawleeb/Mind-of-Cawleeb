# Stay safe in snowy mountains — regardless of how you travel

Hey — Caleb here (commonly pronounced Caw-leeb 😏).

This guide is meant to equip you with baseline knowledge for safe travel in mountainous winter terrain. It supplements — but does not replace — hands-on training, formal courses, and practice with planning and Search and Rescue (SAR) tools.

> This guide expands on the usual advice: "Yes — bring a beacon, shovel, and probe. No — avoid avalanche paths on slopes ≥ 30°." <a href="#full-intro">Read more</a>

## Critical tools

- Beacon, shovel, and probe
- Smartphone or device with a gradient-shaded map (example: CalTopo) and an inclinometer app

## Recommended extras

- First-aid kit
- Extra insulating layers and emergency shelter
- Navigation backup (paper map & compass, extra power)

## Tutorial: Using a slope-angle shader / inclinometer

1. Open your gradient-shaded map (CalTopo, Gaia, etc.) and enable slope shading.
2. Use an inclinometer app or the map's tools to measure the slope angle on your planned route.
3. Treat slopes ≥ 30° as high-risk avalanche terrain and avoid travel there unless you have formal avalanche training and a conservative group decision process.

More detailed examples and step-by-step screenshots can be added here.
